# HighTowers
HighTowers is a project for measuring communication tower height. It uses digital camera metadata of GPS coordinates and camera altitude from digital images taken of communication towers during annual low level route surveys for the U.S. Air Force; additionally Google Maps and Google Places returns tower location coordinates and ground elevation from a map marker location of the tower determined by the application user.

The application is written in Apple Swift for Apple iPads. Presentation materials for detailed operation are available on request.
